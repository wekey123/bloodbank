This  technique <strong>can also  be used</strong> to  find the availability of blood donor without any other contacts. We can also give  request for the particular blood groups. Not only the availability of blood  donors but also <strong>the</strong> details about blood storage, supply and demands <strong>can  be found</strong><br />
    One <strong>important feature</strong> is <strong>the</strong> availability of location  based blood bank details and extraction of location based <strong>donor’s</strong> details which is very <strong>helpful</strong> to the <strong>acceptant</strong>. All the time the  network <strong>facility</strong> cannot be <strong>used</strong>. This time donor request does not  reach <strong>at proper</strong> time. This can be <strong>avoided by</strong> adding some message  sending <strong>procedures</strong>. This will help to find <strong>the </strong>proper blood <strong>donor</strong> in time<strong>. And provides availability of blood in need</strong><br />
    Data mining algorithm helps to identifying groups of records that are  similar <strong>among</strong> themselves but different from the rest of the data. In our  case some of these data <strong>is</strong> useful for identifying <strong>the</strong> proper  blood donors according to the request and location based clustering of data.</p>
